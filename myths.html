    <h3>Jean Vanier CSS's Hackclub :)</h3>
    <p>Here's a few myths we want to bust:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We're not malicious. We create applications and learn how to keep them safe by doing CTF-Capture The Flag competitions. In these competitions, we are given permission to try and find a flag inside a server, website, or application. It's a Hands-On way of learning how to make safe programs</li>
      <br>

      <li>You don't need to know how to code! We need
          <ul>
            <li>Artists- websites have to look pretty!</li>
            <li>Leaders- <strong>people with 3A or B lunch</strong> that help us set up every meeting and have fun with it!</li>
            <li>Passionate people- we want people who make the club a fun place to be! It's not a competition all the time!</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>You don't have to come to every meeting!</strong>- We're like a weekly hackathon!Every meeting, you come by, we do a quick demo, and we set you off to create a spin off of the demo and then share it with everyone. This can include a cool way to solve a CTF problem, sharing an outside project you've been working on, etc! We're here as a community!</li>
